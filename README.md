# numpAI

**numpAI** is a lightweight implementation of neural networks using only NumPy. It provides a simple interface to build, train, and evaluate custom neural networks using common layer types.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still under development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Features

- Modular architecture with a `Network` class and many `Layer` subclasses  
- Support for common layer types (`FCLayer`, `ActivationLayer`, etc.) 
- Forward and backward propagation implemented from scratch   
- Almost no external dependencies beyond NumPy  
- Easy to understand and use

## Installation

## Example Usage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**Do NOT load a model file unless you trained it yourself or fully trust its source.**

The `load` method uses Python‚Äôs `pickle` module, which can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. This can pose serious security risks if the file has been tampered with.
